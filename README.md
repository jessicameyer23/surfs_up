# Surfs Up Summary Statistics:
## Overview 
The purpose of our project and analysis is to provide information to enable W. Avy to make a decision on whether a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year round.  
## Results

I have included the summary statistics for June and December below for comparision purposes and am going to describe three key takeaways.
1.  One key difference is the minimum temperatures between June and December.  The minimum temperature for June is 64 degrees, while the minimum temperature for December is 56 degrees.  It appears that there will be some days in December and during that time of the year where it could be too cold for surfing and where there may be less of a demand for ice cream.  
2.  Another interesting item is that the average temperature for June is 75 degrees and the average for December is 71 degrees, which is only a 4 degree difference.  However, it appears that there is more fluctuation in temperatures in December.  
3.  I have also noted that we have many more data points for June than December, where we have 1517 data points for December and 1700 data points for June.  I would like to understand if there is missing data for December that could be skewing our analysis.

## Summary
Overall, regarding temperatures, it appears that the temperatures would be favorable for our ice cream and surf shop for both June and December.  The average temperatures for June is 75 and the average temperature for December is 71.  December's minimum of 56 may seem a little chilly for surfing, which is why we would like to do some additional analysis to see if December is the coldest month or whether there are other months (such as January and February) that may not be ideal.  If there are only 1-3 months of colder weather, it would most likely be a good investment, but if there are a lot of months of colder and potentially rainy weather, we may need to reconsider our investment (or at least the dollar amount we are putting into this).  See below for a few specific recommendations for further analysis:

1.  I would recommend that we perform additional analyses for each month of the year.  This would enable us to see if there are just one or two months where we are at risk for it being colder for surfing, or whether the temperatures can vary more greatly and there are other months where temperatures may not be ideal.

2.  In addition, I would recommend that we perform additional analysis on the precipitation records by month to see if there are certain months that are more rainy and also compare that data to the temperature months.  Perhaps there are months where the temperatures are great, but it is very rainy; which would not be ideal.  Alternatively, there could be a few months of rain that are also the months where the temperatures aren't ideal.

3.  I would also check to make sure we are comparing and including the same years for analysis in all of our months to ensure we aren't missing any data that could be skewing our results.  If we are comparing the same number of years, the counts should be pretty close for each month.

4.  Lastly, it would be useful to collect data and perform analysis on the temperature of the water by month to better understand how that might impact surfing tendencies.
